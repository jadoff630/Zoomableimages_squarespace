# Zoomableimages_squarespace
This repository functions as a storehouse for OpenSeaDragon JS files as well as my zoomable image files in order to utilize the zoom and annotation features on a squarespace site (that does not allow for self organized folder file systems). Will be used on www.julianadoff.com.
