# Zoomableimages_squarespace
This repository functions as a storehouse for OpenSeaDragon JS files as well as my zoomable image files in order to utilize the zoom and annotation features on a squarespace site (that does not allow for self organized folder file systems). Accessable as a github page (https://jadoff630.github.io/Zoomableimages_squarespace/) and then will be used on www.julianadoff.com.
